## Error Stack Traces

A piece of software, called a compiler, is trying to translate your code so that your computer can understand and run it.
If the compiler comes across a piece of code that it can’t interpret it throws an error back to you to let you know that it has to stop and why.

This information is logged as an error stack trace — a printed message containing information about where the error occurred, what type of error was thrown, and a description of the error.

## Reading Error Stack Traces

- <b>In what line did the error occur?</b> You can almost always find this information on the first line of the stack trace in the following format <b>file path/file name:line number</b>
- <b>What type of error was thrown?</b> The first word on the fifth line of the stack trace is the type of error that was thrown. 
- <b>What is the error message?</b> The rest of the fifth line after the error type provides an error message, describing what went wrong.
  

## JavaScript Error Types

- <b>SyntaxError</b>: This error will be thrown when a typo creates invalid code — code that cannot be interpreted by the compiler. When this error is thrown, scan your code to make sure you properly opened and closed all brackets, braces, and parentheses and that you didn’t include any invalid semicolons.
- <b>ReferenceError</b>: This error will be thrown if you try to use a variable that does not exist. When this error is thrown, make sure all variables are properly declared.
- <b>TypeError</b>: This error will be thrown if you attempt to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For example, if we tried to use a string method on a number, it would throw a TypeError.


## Debugging Errors
- Run your code. Using the first error’s stack trace, identify the error’s type, description, and location.
- Go to the file name and line number indicated by the error stack trace. Using the error type and description, identify the bug in your code.
- Fix the bug and re-run your code.
- Repeat steps 1-3 until your code no longer throws any errors.
