## Arrays

Organizing and storing data is a foundational concept of programming.

One way we organize data in real life is by making lists. 

Arrays are JavaScript’s way of making lists. 
Arrays can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans). 
Like lists, arrays are ordered, meaning each item has a numbered position.

## Create an Array

One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets [].

## Accessing Elements

Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index, which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the item’s position.

Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0. 

Attempting to access an unwritten index will lead to 'undefined'

```
const cities = ['Chicago', 'San Fransisco', 'New York'];
 
console.log(cities[3]);
//Output: undefined
```

You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation and the index. For instance, you can write:

```
const hello = 'Hello World';
console.log(hello[6]);
// Output: W
```

## Update Elements

Once you have access to an element in an array, you can update its value.

```
let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
 
seasons[3] = 'Autumn';
console.log(seasons); 
//Output: ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn']
```

## Arrays with let and const

Variables declared with let can be reassigned.

Variables declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. However, elements in an array declared with const remain mutable. Meaning that we can change the contents of a const array, but cannot reassign a new array or a different value.


```
const countries = ['Japan', 'Denmark', 'Mexico', 'Morocco'];
countries.shift();
console.log(countries); 
countries =  ['England', 'Mozambique', 'Cambodia', 'Peru']; 
console.log(countries); 
```
Will produce ...

```
['Japan', 'Denmark', 'Mexico', 'Morocco']
TypeError: Assignment to a contant variable
```


## Properties

### The .length property

One of an array’s built-in properties is length and it returns the number of items in the array. We access the .length property just like we do with strings. Check the example below:

```
const newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class'];
 
console.log(newYearsResolutions.length);
// Output: 2
```

## Methods

### The .push() Method

Let’s learn about some built-in JavaScript methods that make working with arrays easier. These methods are specifically called on arrays to make common tasks, like adding and removing elements, more straightforward.

One method, .push() allows us to add items to the end of an array. Here is an example of how this is used:

```
const itemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];
 
itemTracker.push('item 3', 'item 4');
 
console.log(itemTracker); 
// Output: ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4'];
```
So, how does .push() work?

We access the push method by using dot notation, connecting push to itemTracker with a period.
Then we call it like a function. That’s because .push() is a function and one that JavaScript allows us to use right on an array.
.push() can take a single argument or multiple arguments separated by commas. In this case, we’re adding two elements: 'item 3' and 'item 4' to itemTracker.
Notice that .push() changes, or mutates, itemTracker. You might also see .push() referred to as a destructive array method since it changes the initial array.


### The .pop() Method
Another array method, .pop(), removes the last item of an array.

```
const newItemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];
 
const removed = newItemTracker.pop();
 
console.log(newItemTracker); 
// Output: [ 'item 0', 'item 1' ]
console.log(removed);
// Output: item 2
```

In the example above, calling .pop() on the newItemTracker array removed item 2 from the end.
.pop() does not take any arguments, it simply removes the last element of newItemTracker.
.pop() returns the value of the last element. In the example, we store the returned value in a variable removed to be used for later.
.pop() is a method that mutates the initial array.
 
### .slice()
 
The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.


### .indexOf()

The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.


## Arrays & Functions

When you pass an array into a function, if the array is mutated inside the function, that change will be maintained outside the function as well. You might also see this concept explained as pass-by-reference since what we’re actually passing the function is a reference to where the variable memory is stored and changing the memory.

```
const flowers = ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold'];
 
function addFlower(arr) {
  arr.push('lily');
}
 
addFlower(flowers);
 
console.log(flowers); // Output: ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold', 'lily']
```

## Nested Arrays

Earlier we mentioned that arrays can store other arrays. When an array contains another array it is known as a nested array. Examine the example below:

```
const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];
To access the nested arrays we can use bracket notation with the index value, just like we did to access any other element:

const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];
 
console.log(nestedArr[1]); // Output: [2, 3]
```

Notice that nestedArr[1] will grab the element in index 1 which is the array [2, 3]. Then, if we wanted to access the elements within the nested array we can chain, or add on, more bracket notation with index values.

```
const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];
 
console.log(nestedArr[1]); // Output: [2, 3]
console.log(nestedArr[1][0]); // Output: 2
```
