An important idea in programming is scope. Scope defines where variables can be accessed or referenced. While some variables can be accessed from anywhere within a program, other variables may only be available in a specific context.
Scope is the context in which our variables are declared. We think about scope in relation to blocks because variables can exist either outside of or within these blocks.

## Blocks and Scope

A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. Blocks help us group one or more statements together and serve as an important structural marker for our code.

## Global Scope

In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks. These variables are called global variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any code in the program, including code in blocks.

## Block Scope

The next context we’ll cover is block scope. When a variable is defined inside a block, it is only accessible to the code within the curly braces {}.
Variables that are declared with block scope are known as local variables because they are only available to the code that is part of the same block.

## Scope Pollution

When you declare global variables, they go to the global namespace. The global namespace allows the variables to be accessible from anywhere in the program. These variables remain there until the program finishes which means our global namespace can fill up really quickly.
Scope pollution is when we have too many global variables that exist in the global namespace, or when we reuse variables across different scopes. Scope pollution makes it difficult to keep track of our different variables and sets us up for potential accidents. For example, globally scoped variables can collide with other variables that are more locally scoped, causing unexpected behavior in our code.

```
let num = 50;
 
const logNum = () => {
  num = 100; // Take note of this line of code
  console.log(num);
};
 
logNum(); // Prints 100
console.log(num); // Prints 100
```

Even though the reassignment is allowed and we won’t get an error, if we decided to use num later, we’ll unknowingly use the new value of num.

## Practice Good Scoping

Given the challenges with global variables and scope pollution, we should follow best practices for scoping our variables as tightly as possible using block scope.

Tightly scoping your variables will greatly improve your code in several ways:

- It will make your code more legible since the blocks will organize your code into discrete sections.
- It makes your code more understandable since it clarifies which variables are associated with different parts of the program rather than having to keep track of them line after line!
- It’s easier to maintain your code, since your code will be modular.
- It will save memory in your code because it will cease to exist after the block finishes running.
