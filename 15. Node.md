Javascript has existed since 1995 and has since taken over as the dominant language for web development. For much of its life, JavaScript was used mainly for client-side scripting inside <script> tags executing in web browsers. This limitation meant that developers were often working in many different languages and frameworks between the front-end (client-side) and backend (server-side) aspects of a web application.

Although there were other projects to bring JavaScript to server-side applications, the functionality took off with the launch of Node.js in 2009. Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

Node.js is written in C, C++, and JavaScript, and it is built on the open-source V8 JavaScript engine which also powers JS in browsers such as Google Chrome. As V8 supports new features in JavaScript, they are incorporated into Node.

## Node-Specific Functionality
### Globals
  
Node provides access to several important global objects for use with Node program files. When writing a file that will run in a Node environment, these variables will be accessible in the global scope of your file.

- module is an object referring to the functionality that will be exported from a file. In Node, each file is treated as a module.
- require() is a function used to import modules from other files or Node packages.
- process is an object referencing to the actual computer process running a Node program and allows for access to command-line arguments and much more.

  
### Modules
  
Node has a many built-in modules to aid in interactions with the command line, the computer file system, and the Internet. These include

HTTP and HTTPS for creating web servers.
File System, OS, and Path for interacting with the file system, operating system, and file/directory paths.
