## What are Functions?

A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

## Function Declarations

```
function getReminder() {
  console.log('Water the plants.');
}
```
A function declaration consists of:

- The function keyword.
- The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.
- A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, { }.

This function call executes the function body, or all of the statements between the curly braces in the function declaration.

## Parameters and Arguments

Parameters allow functions to accept input(s) and perform a task using the input(s). We use parameters as placeholders for information that will be passed to the function when it is called.

The values that are passed to the function when it is called are called arguments. Arguments can be passed to the function as values or variables.

## Default Parameters

One of the features added in ES6 is the ability to use default parameters. Default parameters allow parameters to have a predetermined value in case there is no argument passed into the function or if the argument is undefined when called.

```
function greeting (name = 'stranger') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
greeting('Nick') // Output: Hello, Nick!

greeting() // Output: Hello, stranger!
```

## Return

To pass back information from the function call, we use a return statement.
To create a return statement, we use the return keyword followed by the value that we wish to return. If the value is omitted, undefined is returned instead.
When a return statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped and the code that follows it will not be executed. 
The return keyword is powerful because it allows functions to produce an output. We can then save the output to a variable for later use.

## Function Expression

```
 const plantNeedsWater = function (day) {
  if (day === 'Wednesday') {
    return true;
  }
   return false;
}
```
In a function expression, the function name is usually omitted. A function with no name is called an anonymous function. A function expression is often stored in a variable in order to refer to it.
Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted so they cannot be called before they are defined.

To declare a function expression:

- Declare a variable to make the variable’s name be the name, or identifier, of your function. Since the release of ES6, it is common practice to use const as the keyword to declare the variable.
- Assign as that variable’s value an anonymous function created by using the function keyword followed by a set of parentheses with possible parameters. Then a set of curly braces that contain the function body.

## Arrow Functions

```
const plantNeedsWater = (day) => {
  if (day === 'Wednesday') {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```
ES6 introduced arrow function syntax, a shorter way to write functions by using the special “fat arrow” () => notation.

Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword function every time you need to create a function. 

## Concise Body Arrow Functions

The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body. We’ll explore a few of these techniques below:

- Functions that take only a single parameter do not need that parameter to be enclosed in parentheses. 
  - However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.
- A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly braces. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow => and the return keyword can be removed. This is referred to as implicit return.

```
const squareNum = num => num * num;
```
