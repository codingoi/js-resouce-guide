While sometimes used interchangeably, programming and coding actually have different definitions.

Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.

Computers interpret instructions in a very literal manner, so we have to be very specific in how we program them.
