## Conditionals

A conditional statement checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s).

Comparison operators and their syntax:

- Less than: <
- Greater than: >
- Less than or equal to: <=
- Greater than or equal to: >=
- Is equal to: ===
- Is not equal to: !==


## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right. 

 In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as logical operators. 
 
 There are three logical operators:

- the and operator (&&)
- the or operator (||)
- the not operator, otherwise known as the bang operator (!)


## Truthy and Falsy

The list of falsy values includes:

- 0
- Empty strings like "" or ''
- null which represent when there is no value at all
- undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
- NaN, or Not a Number

We can use a ternary operator to simplify an if...else statement.

```
isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');
```


## Switch

A switch statement provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A switch statement looks like this:

```
let groceryItem = 'papaya';
 
switch (groceryItem) {
  case 'tomato':
    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
    break;
  case 'lime':
    console.log('Limes are $1.49');
    break;
  case 'papaya':
    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Invalid item');
    break;
}
 
// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'
```
- The switch keyword initiates the statement and is followed by ( ... ), which contains the value that each case will compare.
- Inside the block, { ... }, there are multiple cases. The case keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it.
- The break keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without break keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matchesâ€”including the default. This behavior is different from if/else conditional statements that execute only one block of code.
- At the end of each switch statement, there is a default statement. If none of the cases are true, then the code in the default statement will run.
