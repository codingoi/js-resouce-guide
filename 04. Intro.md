## Arithmetic Operators

An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. 
JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic operators, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:

- Add: +
- Subtract: -
- Multiply: *
- Divide: /
- Remainder: %


## Mathematical Assignment Operators

- +=
- -=
- *=
- /=

- ++ (ncrement operator)
- -- (decrement operator)

## String Concatenation

Operators aren’t just for numbers! When a + operator is used on two strings, it appends the right string to the left string:

```
console.log('hi' + 'ya'); // Prints 'hiya'
```

This process of appending one string to another is called concatenation.


## String Concatenation with Variables

```
let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
```

## String Interpolation

In the ES6 version of JavaScript, we can insert, or interpolate, variables into strings using template literals. 

Notice that:

- A template literal is wrapped by backticks ``.
- Inside the template literal, you’ll see a placeholder, ${myPet}. The value of myPet is inserted into the template literal.
- When we interpolate `I own a pet ${myPet}.`, the output we print is the string: 'I own a pet armadillo.'

## Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. 
Ex: Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in that string.

```
console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5
```

## Methods

Methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

- a period (the dot operator)
- the name of the method
- opening and closing parentheses
E.g. 'example string'.methodName()

## Built-in Objects

Objects can have methods.
Ex: Let’s call the .random() method from the built-in Math object:

```
console.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1

```
