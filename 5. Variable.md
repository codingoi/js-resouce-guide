A variable is a container for a value. 
You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. 

Variables are not values; they contain values and represent them with a name.

A standard convention in JavaScript called camel casing. 
In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything).

There are a few general rules for naming variables:

- Variable names cannot start with numbers.
- Variable names are case sensitive, so myName and myname would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
- Variable names cannot be the same as keywords.

## var

var, short for variable, is a JavaScript keyword that creates, or declares, a new variable.

## let

The let keyword signals that the variable can be reassigned a different value. 
Using let (and var) we can declare a variable without assigning the variable a value. In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of undefined:

```
let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
```

## const

const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant. 
If you try to reassign a const variable, you’ll get a TypeError.
Constant variables must be assigned a value when declared. If you try to declare a const variable without a value, you’ll get a SyntaxError.

## typeof operator

While writing code, it can be useful to keep track of the data types of the variables in your program. If you need to check the data type of a variable’s value, you can use the typeof operator.

The typeof operator checks the value to its right and returns, or passes back, a string of the data type.

```
const unknown1 = 'foo';
console.log(typeof unknown1); // Output: string
 
const unknown2 = 10;
console.log(typeof unknown2); // Output: number
```
