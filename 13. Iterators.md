# Higher Order Functions

In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs. If you encountered countToThree() in a program, you might be able to quickly guess what the function did without having to stop and read the function’s body.

Higher-order functions are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions.

## Functions as Data

JavaScript functions behave like any other data type in the language; we can assign functions to variables, and we can reassign them to new variables.

Below, we have an annoyingly long function name that hurts the readability of any code in which it’s used. Let’s pretend this function does important work and needs to be called repeatedly!

```
const announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork = () => {
    console.log("I’m doing very important work!");
};
```
What if we wanted to rename this function without sacrificing the source code? We can re-assign the function to a variable with a suitably short name:

```
const busy = announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork;
 
busy(); // This function call barely takes any space!
```

busy is a variable that holds a reference to our original function. If we could look up the address in memory of busy and the address in memory of announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork they would point to the same place. Our new busy() function can be invoked with parentheses as if that was the name we originally gave our function.

Notice how we assign announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork without parentheses as the value to the busy variable. We want to assign the value of the function itself, not the value it returns when invoked.

In JavaScript, functions are first class objects. This means that, like other objects you’ve encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods.

Since functions are a type of object, they have properties such as .length and .name and methods such as .toString(). 


## Functions as Parameters

A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both! We call the functions that get passed in as parameters and invoked callback functions because they get called during the execution of the higher-order function.

When we pass a function in as an argument to another function, we don’t invoke it. Invoking the function would evaluate to the return value of that function call. With callbacks, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name without the parentheses (that would evaluate to the result of calling the function):

```
const timeFuncRuntime = funcParameter => {
   let t1 = Date.now();
   funcParameter();
   let t2 = Date.now();
   return t2 - t1;
}
 
const addOneToOne = () => 1 + 1;
 
timeFuncRuntime(addOneToOne);
```
```
timeFuncRuntime(() => {
  for (let i = 10; i>0; i--){
    console.log(i);
  }
});
```
In this example, we invoked timeFuncRuntime() with an anonymous function that counts backwards from 10. Anonymous functions can be arguments too!


# Interators

The built-in JavaScript array methods that help us iterate are called iteration methods, at times referred to as iterators. Iterators are methods called on arrays to manipulate elements and return values.

## The .forEach() Method

Aptly named, .forEach() will execute the same code for each element of an array.

A way to pass a callback for .forEach() is to use arrow function syntax.
```
groceries.forEach(groceryItem => console.log(groceryItem));
```

We can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.

```
function printGrocery(element){
  console.log(element);
}
 
groceries.forEach(printGrocery);
```

## The .map() Method

When .map() is called on an array, it takes an argument of a callback function and returns a new array! Take a look at an example of calling .map()

.map() works in a similar manner to .forEach()— the major difference is that .map() returns a new array.

```
const bigNumbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

// Create the smallNumbers array below

const smallNumbers = bigNumbers.map((num) => {return num/100})

console.log(smallNumbers)
// Output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

## The .filter() Method

Another useful iterator method is .filter(). Like .map(), .filter() returns a new array. However, .filter() returns an array of elements after filtering out certain elements from the original array. The callback function for the .filter() method should return true or false depending on the element that is passed to it. The elements that cause the callback function to return true are added to the new array. Take a look at the following example:

```
const words = ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']; 
 
const shortWords = words.filter(word => {
  return word.length < 6;
});
```

## The .findIndex() Method

We sometimes want to find the location of an element in an array. That’s where the .findIndex() method comes in! Calling .findIndex() on an array will return the index of the first element that evaluates to true in the callback function.

```
const jumbledNums = [123, 25, 78, 5, 9]; 
 
const lessThanTen = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {
  return num < 10;
});

console.log(lessThanTen); // Output: 3 

```
If there isn’t a single element in the array that satisfies the condition in the callback, then .findIndex() will return -1.

## The .reduce() Method

The .reduce() method returns a single value after iterating through the elements of an array, thereby reducing the array. 

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];
 
const summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue
})
 
console.log(summedNums) // Output: 17
```

## The .some() Method

The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns false. It doesn't modify the array.

## The .every() Method

The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
