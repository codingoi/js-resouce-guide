## Looping through Arrays

for loops are very handy for iterating over data structures. For example, we can use a for loop to perform the same operation on each element on an array. 

```
const animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];
for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++){
  console.log(animals[i]);
}
```
This example would give you the following output:
```
Grizzly Bear
Sloth
Sea Lion
```
In the loop above, we’ve named our iterator variable i. This is a variable naming convention you’ll see in a lot of loops. When we use i to iterate through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word index. 

## Nested Loops

When we have a loop running inside another loop, we call that a nested loop. One use for a nested for loop is to compare the elements in two arrays. For each round of the outer for loop, the inner for loop will run completely.

Let’s look at an example of a nested for loop:

```
const myArray = [6, 19, 20];
const yourArray = [19, 81, 2];
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < yourArray.length; j++) {
    if (myArray[i] === yourArray[j]) {
      console.log('Both loops have the number: ' + yourArray[j])
    }
  }
};
```
Let’s think about what’s happening in the nested loop in our example. For each element in the outer loop array, myArray, the inner loop will run in its entirety comparing the current element from the outer array, myArray[i], to each element in the inner array, yourArray[j]. When it finds a match, it prints a string to the console.

## The While Loop

To start, let’s convert a for loop into a while loop:

```
// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
for (let counterOne = 1; counterOne < 4; counterOne++){
  console.log(counterOne);
}
 
// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
let counterTwo = 1;
while (counterTwo < 4) {
  console.log(counterTwo);
  counterTwo++;
}
```
Let’s break down what’s happening with our while loop syntax:

- The counterTwo variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our while loop since it’s in the global scope.
- We start our loop with the keyword while followed by our stopping condition, or test condition. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to true, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to false the loop will stop.
- Next, we have our loop’s code block which prints counterTwo to the console and increments counterTwo.

What would happen if we didn’t increment counterTwo inside our block? If we didn’t include this, counterTwo would always have its initial value, 1. That would mean the testing condition counterTwo < 4 would always evaluate to true and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an infinite loop and it’s something we always want to avoid. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer’s processing power potentially freezing your computer.

So you may be wondering when to use a while loop! The syntax of a for loop is ideal when we know how many times the loop should run, but we don’t always know this in advance.


## Do...While Statements

In some cases, you want a piece of code to run at least once and then loop based on a specific condition after its initial run. This is where the do...while statement comes in.

A do...while statement says to do a task once and then keep doing it until a specified condition is no longer met. The syntax for a do...while statement looks like this:

```
let countString = '';
let i = 0;
 
do {
  countString = countString + i;
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
 
console.log(countString);

```
In this example, the code block makes changes to the countString variable by appending the string form of the i variable to it. First, the code block after the do keyword is executed once. Then the condition is evaluated. If the condition evaluates to true, the block will execute again. The looping stops when the condition evaluates to false.

Note that the while and do...while loop are different! Unlike the while loop, do...while will run at least once whether or not the condition evaluates to true.


## The break Keyword

The break keyword allows programs to “break” out of the loop from within the loop’s block.

Let’s check out the syntax of a break keyword:

```
for (let i = 0; i < 99; i++) {
  if (i > 2 ) {
     break;
  }
  console.log('Banana.');
}
 
console.log('Orange you glad I broke out the loop!');
```

## for loop vs for…of loop
Here is an example of iterating over each element in an array using a traditional for loop with an index variable:

```
const hobbies = ['singing', 'eating', 'quidditch', 'writing'];
 
for (let i = 0; i < hobbies.length; i++) {
  console.log(`I enjoy ${hobbies[i]}.`);
}
```
And here is an example of iterating through the same array using a for...of loop:

```
const hobbies = ['singing', 'eating', 'quidditch', 'writing'];
 
for (const hobby of hobbies) {
  console.log(`I enjoy ${hobby}.`);
}
```
Both examples print out the same thing:

```
I enjoy singing.
I enjoy eating.
I enjoy quidditch.
I enjoy writing.
```
One of the primary uses of the for...of loop is iterating through the items of an array.
The for...of can also be used to iterate over strings. 

## Break and Continue
for...of has the advantage of setting up most of your loop parameters for you, but sometimes it is necessary to reclaim some control of how iteration is managed. One way of doing this is using JavaScript’s break and continue statements.

The break statement can be used to jump out of a loop. For example:

```
const strangeBirds = ['Shoebill', 'Cockatrice', 'Basan', 'Terrorbird','Parotia','Kakapo'];
 
for (const bird of strangeBirds) {
  if (bird === 'Basan'){ 
    break; 
  }
  console.log(bird);
}
```
The continue statement is used to skip one iteration of the loop. For example:

```
const strangeBirds = ['Shoebill', 'Cockatrice', 'Basan', 'Cow', 'Terrorbird', 'Parotia', 'Kakapo'];
 
for (const bird of strangeBirds) {
  if  (bird === 'Cow'){
    continue;
  }
  console.log(bird);
}
```
