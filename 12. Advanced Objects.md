## The this Keyword

```
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(dietType);
  }
};
goat.diet(); 
// Output will be "ReferenceError: dietType is not defined"
```

That’s strange, why is dietType not defined even though it’s a property of goat? That’s because inside the scope of the .diet() method, we don’t automatically have access to other properties of the goat object.

Here’s where the this keyword comes to the rescue. If we change the .diet() method to use the this, the .diet() works! :

```
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};
 
goat.diet(); 
// Output: herbivore
```
The this keyword references the calling object which provides access to the calling object’s properties. In the example above, the calling object is goat and by using this we’re accessing the goat object itself, and then the dietType property of goat by using property dot notation.

## Arrow Functions and this

```
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet: () => {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};
 
goat.diet(); // Prints undefined
```
Arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, an already defined this value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object.

## Privacy

Accessing and updating properties is fundamental in working with objects. However, there are cases in which we don’t want other code simply accessing and updating an object’s properties. When discussing privacy in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.

Certain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore _ before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here’s an example of using _ to prepend a property.

```
const bankAccount = {
  _amount: 1000
}
```
In the example above, the _amount is not intended to be directly manipulated.

Even so, it is still possible to reassign _amount:
```
bankAccount._amount = 1000000;
```

## Getters

Getters are methods that get and return the internal properties of an object. But they can do more than just retrieve the value of a property! Let’s take a look at a getter method:

```
const person = {
  _firstName: 'John',
  _lastName: 'Doe',
  get fullName() {
    if (this._firstName && this._lastName){
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    } else {
      return 'Missing a first name or a last name.';
    }
  }
}
 
// To call the getter method: 
person.fullName; // 'John Doe'
```
Notice that in the getter method above:

- We use the get keyword followed by a function.
- We use an if...else conditional to check if both _firstName and _lastName exist (by making sure they both return truthy values) and then return a different value depending on the result.
- We can access the calling object’s internal properties using this. In fullName, we’re accessing both this._firstName and this._lastName.
- In the last line we call fullName on person. In general, getter methods do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we’re accessing a property.

Now that we’ve gone over syntax, let’s discuss some notable advantages of using getter methods:

- Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
- Getters can return different values using conditionals.
- In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
- The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand.

<b>person.fullName() // because we wrote a getter, this line is looking for a regular method called .fullName() and would cause an error </b>

Another thing to keep in mind when using getter (and setter) methods is that properties cannot share the same name as the getter/setter function. 

## Setters

Along with getter methods, we can also create setter methods which reassign values of existing properties within an object. Let’s see an example of a setter method:

```
const person = {
  _age: 37,
  set age(newAge){
    if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('You must assign a number to age');
    }
  }
};
```
Setter methods like age do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we’re reassigning the value of a property.

```
person.age = 40
```
Like getter methods, there are similar advantages to using setter methods that include checking input, performing actions on properties, and displaying a clear intention for how the object is supposed to be used. Nonetheless, even with a setter method, it is still possible to directly reassign properties. For example, in the example above, we can still set ._age directly:

```
person._age = 'forty-five'
console.log(person._age); // Prints forty-five
```

## Factory Functions

```const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
  return { 
    name: name,
    age: age, 
    energySource: energySource,
    scare() {
      console.log(catchPhrase);
    } 
  }
};
```
In the monsterFactory function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: name, age, energySource, and scare(). To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call monsterFactory with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:

```
const ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');
ghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'
```
With monsterFactory in place, we don’t have to create an object literal every time we need a new monster. Instead, we can invoke the monsterFactory function with the necessary arguments.

## Property Value Shorthand

ES6 introduced some new shortcuts for assigning properties to variables known as destructuring.

we can use a destructuring technique, called property value shorthand, to save ourselves some keystrokes. The example below works exactly like the example above:

```
const monsterFactory = (name, age) => {
  return { 
    name,
    age 
  }
};
```

## Destructured Assignment

If we wanted to extract the residence property as a variable, we could using the following code:

```
const residence = vampire.residence; 
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania' 
```
However, we can also take advantage of a destructuring technique called destructured assignment to save ourselves some keystrokes. In destructured assignment we create a variable with the name of an object’s key that is wrapped in curly braces { } and assign to it the object. Take a look at the example below:

```
const { residence } = vampire; 
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'
```

## Built-in Object Methods

### Object.keys(object)

The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, iterated in the same order that a normal loop would.

```
const robotKeys = Object.keys(robot);

console.log(robotKeys);
//Output: [ 'model', 'mobile', 'sentient', 'armor', 'energyLevel' ]
```

### Object.entries(object)

The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. (The only important difference is that a for...in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well). 

The order of the array returned by Object.entries() does not depend on how an object is defined. If there is a need for certain ordering, then the array should be sorted first, like Object.entries(obj).sort((a, b) => b[0].localeCompare(a[0]));.

```
const robotEntries = Object.entries(robot)
console.log(robotEntries);

//Output: [ [ 'model', 'SAL-1000' ],
  [ 'mobile', true ],
  [ 'sentient', false ],
  [ 'armor', 'Steel-plated' ],
  [ 'energyLevel', 75 ] ]
```

### Object.assign(target, source)

The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.

```
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target);
// expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

console.log(returnedTarget);
// expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
```
<b> The target will be changed </b>

To make a copy, as to not modify the original target

```
let robotCopy = Object.assign({}, robot)
const newRobot = Object.assign(robotCopy, {laserBlaster: true, voiceRecognition: true} )
console.log(newRobot);

//Output: { model: 'SAL-1000',
  mobile: true,
  sentient: false,
  armor: 'Steel-plated',
  energyLevel: 75,
  laserBlaster: true,
  voiceRecognition: true }
```
